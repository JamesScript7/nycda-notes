Object Oriented Programming

organizing your code and making them into nouns!

DOM
an abstraction of getting the object from the document.
the end result is an object you can manipulate.

the element is the most robust object.

checkout mozilla for object oriented programming.
(JS is quirky compared to the other languages)

string is actually an object...

method is another word for function.

object is an arbitray data structure
array is a list of data

this

in general it refers to the object it's in.


use:
.bind() is used for events
.call()

yellowSub.summary.call(yellowSub);


Prototypes:
object - string - and your string

when you create a string you get stuff from Object prototype

constructors should be simple...

class...
constructor...
prototype... template that becomes part of the object

JS is prototype based language.. function based.. and then objects.

start with plain objects.. then constructor.. then make it a function.. then create a prototype.
