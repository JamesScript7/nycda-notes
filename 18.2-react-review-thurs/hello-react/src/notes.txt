Go language is the fastest Language out there

node is based off of V8 engine


"jest" is designed to test components

setState tells react something changed
it'll call render again to refresh the info

saving state b4:

<div class="counter" data-value="1">
<span class="value">1</span>
</div>

you have a seperation of DOM with REACT
jQuery has to pull info out of the DOM and put it back in

make an automatic default for props

or a warning in the constructor
if (!props.start) {
	console.warn("");
}


Have a button cycle through an array
