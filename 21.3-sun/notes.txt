REACT review

A reducer that does something to a number

function g(number, action) {
	return number + 2;
}

A reducer you want lots of actions that components can subcribe to.

calc(50, { type: CLEAR })


Twitter example:

To make it redux friendly:
	actions = will transform state into new state
	reducer = 
	state = array of strings

actions
ADD_STATUS
REMOVE_STATUS

ADD_STATUS "HI"

props go from the outside in.

you can't change the props once they are inside the component.

parent components will subscribe to state changes

child will dispatch to REDUX

and the parent listening and is subscribed to REDUX

action creators
very simple functions that return actions.

const actions = {
	addStatus: function(statusText)
}

//actions:
function createAddStatusAction(statusText) {
	return {
		type: "ADD_STATUS",
		newStatus: statusText
	}
}

createAddStatusAction("Hi!");



function createAddAction(value) {
	return {
		type: "ADD",
		number: value
	}
}

store.dispatch(
	createAddAction(3)
)
