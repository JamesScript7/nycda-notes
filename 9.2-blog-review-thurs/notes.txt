nodemon


middleware?

you can just write contacts without contacts.ejs because of the view engine.

body parser: takes the request coming in and formats it.

post can only add stuff to the database

in certain cases we can have the ejs render.
you don't have to render something with POST

partial*

sudo npm install -g nodemon
so you wont have to close your server everytime you make a change.
