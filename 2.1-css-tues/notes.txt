you can't hover over something that's hiding

positioning:
move stuff around!

static:

relative:
affects only the selected element!
doesn't shift other elements on the line;

position fixed:

a fixed position element can cover up previous element.

absolute positioning:

the parent element needs to be relative for the sibling to be absolute!
or else it'll go to the body element.


z-index for foward back (a higher z-index will be in front)


floats:

float: left
float: right


you can use floats to make 2 column pages

to get rid of inline block spaces... use float left.


text will wrap around a float
float will ignore height!

clear will "draw a new line" and stop the float flow.

clear left, right, or both
