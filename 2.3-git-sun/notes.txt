Working tree

A commit is a snap shot of your project

edge case - not the normal day to day usage... one in a million type of problem...

git has a three layer repository system

Working tree
	Stage - index (staging area)
		git data Base

git diff commit# commit#
to see the difference between those 2 git commits.

git add .
add everything in current directory

ls *.html
or
ls worktree.*

git show
git log

git status
git add (to stage)
git commit -m 'message'
git show
git log

to delete
git rm index.html

git checkout
will restore the last commit

git reset
will remove from staging area


Branches!
lets you make a complete copy of the code your working on.


git diff bar (when you are in master, then it'll show you what's the difference.)

git branch -d (safe delete, compared to -D) bar (will delete)

merge:

git merge whatever (be sure to be in the branch that you want to merge it into)

Conflicts:

github
push and pull

push is an upload and a merge

pull is ur merging the commits from the server to your computer

git clone http://....

when adding a wild card, put it in quotes so that it not only adds files in the current directory but all of them.

git add '*.txt'

git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git

-u
tells git to remember the parameters.

--staged
type it with git diff --staged to see changes you just staged.

git reset to unstage
