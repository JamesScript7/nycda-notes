JavaScript:

but first... git review:
git checkout -

input - program - output

programming concepts:
variables, operators, conditionals, arrays, loops

variables stores:
integers
floats
strings
boolean (after mathematician named Bool)
dates/times
more types...

JS uses camelcase
Ruby uses underscore

variables are placeholders for data

How to put JS in your webpage

<script> </script>

you can do % 60 to find out

concat


var s1 = 1;
var s2 = 2;

console.log(s1 + ", " + s2);

debugging:
console.log("s1 is now: "+ s1);

so you can find out what the variable s1 is.

! = not operator

&&

groups comparisons together
every expression must be true to evaluate to true

||

if one of them are true then expression will evaulate to true.

Conditionals

"" = blank(empty) string

Arrays:

if you change index to a variable then you can use that to reference when calling an array

var list = ["first", 2, "third"];

var index = 0;

list[index] = "1st";

>> ["1st", 2, "third"];

arrays are mutable?

push = adds array item to the end of the list

shift = removes last array item

unshift = adds array item in front

LOOPS:

while

var list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];

var i = 0;

while (i < list.length) {
	console.log(list[i]);
	i++;
}

javascript interpreter

(initialize; condition; what to do after)

while loop = when you don't know the number of times you have to loop.

for loops = most common loop.

when you want to increment by 2.
i+=2
