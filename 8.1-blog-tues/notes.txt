EXPRESS REVIEW:

listens for http request
"route" requests

http lib in node to create you won version for express if you want.

(will go over sending JSON when reaching AJAX)

types of views:
EJS
Pug

POST requests:
gernerally happening when sending a form.

uploading a video: POST req
finding a video: GET req

any url you type into a browser... GET
filling out a form... POST

You have to install this to use POST request:

npm install --save body-parser

JSON:
app.use(bodyParser.json());

FORM:
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true}));

app.post('/guess', function(req,res) {
	var guess = req.body.guess;
	...
	res.send(msg);
}


get req: item potent. you get a specific thing.. it should not change the contents of the server... for reading

post req: not item potent. you're allowed to change something on the server. posting email, tweet, etc. you'll get something different in your inbox or page... for posting. MORE SECURE. the proper way to get real data into the server.

REST: way to map the get and post system in the database.


post: you don't see it on the address bar.


content type:
app.get('/some/route', function(req,res) {
	res.set('Content-Type', 'text/html');
	res.send("<h1>HTML</h1>");
})

can be: text/plain, image/pic.png, application/javascript


Middleware:
a function that runs

so place it before your route

you can keep track of logging in.

app.use(function(request, response, next) {
	var d = new Date();
	if (d.getHours() > 18) {
	response.status(401).send("sorry, we're closed");
	} else {
		next();
	}
});
