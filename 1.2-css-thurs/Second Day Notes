Internal links

<a id="top" href="#bottom">
	Go to Bottom

you can add target="_blank" as an attribute in your anchor tag.


<div> block tag

Lecture 1.2
Element is a chunk of HTML from begining to end.

CSS!

If you're adding inline css styles and if it's only one attribute then you don't need a semi colon

ex:
<p style="color: blue">
</p>

<div>
<a>
Links do not inhert color
</a>

unless this special instruction is used!

<div style="color: black">
  <a style="color: inherit"
	href="">
	LINK
  </a>
</div>

CSS rules

selector {
	attribute: value;
}


You can have multiple selectors in a rule
You won't have to type in the colors twice.

.intro, .outro {
	color: blue;
}

DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself


div.intro
It'll only match div tags with class intro
It won't match p tags with class intro


anchor tag nested withing an element with a menu class nested within an element with a header class nested within an element with an about class.


Nested attributes

.about .header .menu a {
	
}

To make changes on both:

.about .header .menu a,
.about .header .menu a {
	
}

When you draw on the whiteboard and sketch out the page, thats called wireframe.

nav, section, header, and footer tags are some of the new tags in HTML5

mainly for google

Google tends to grab h1 elements


If an element has 2 classes you have to keep the classes together in the selector

.nav.menu a {
	
}

<ul class="nav menu">
	<a>

	</a>
</ul>

class names take precedence over tag names
or if they are equal the last one wins.

or whatever selector that is more specific
